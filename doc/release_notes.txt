jaqlib-0.9
----------

JaqLib supports quering collections that implement the 'java.lang.Iterable' interface out of the box.
Other sources that should be queried can be integrated into the library by implementing an own
'org.jaqlib.query.QueryBuilder'.
Where conditions can be defined by using a method call recording mechanism. This mechanism uses dynamic
proxies for recording method calls. Because dynamic proxies can only be applied to interfaces the
open source library CgLib can be optionally used to proxy classes. This release was tested with
CgLib 2.1_3 (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/cglib/cglib-nodep-2.1_3.jar).
