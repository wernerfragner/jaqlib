==Introduction==
JaqLib (Java Query Library) is a compact Java library that supports programmers in querying all sorts of collections and databases in a compact and intuitive manner.

<p>
WHERE conditions can be specified by user defined implementations of the <tt>WhereCondition</tt> interface, by using the <tt>where().element()</tt> expression and by using a <b>method call recording mechanism</b> (see also the first
example below). First the programmer must call the desired method on the
returned proxy object. This method call is recorded by JaQLib. When
evaluating the WHERE condition this method call is replayed on every element.
The result of this method call is then evaluated against the specified
condition.

But examples are always better than some abstract descriptions. So lets start with some basic examples:
</p> 

* [[Iterable Queries]]
* [[Database Queries]]


==Usage Scenarios==
* Selecting arbitrary elements from collections, maps, ... in everyday programming tasks.
* Using the database query support for unit testing. E.g., when you want to read back previously inserted/updated/deleted data from database in order to check if the unittest worked correctly.
* Using the database query support for simple applications that need a quick an easy way to select data from database (without the coding overhead of JDBC or OR-Mappers like [http://www.hibernate.org Hibernate], [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/toplink/index.html Oracle TopLink], [http://ibatis.apache.org iBatis], ...).
