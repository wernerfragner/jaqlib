/**
 * <p>
 * The main entry point of JaQLib for XML query support. It provides following
 * methods for building queries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #select(Class)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #select(BeanMapping)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Method {@link #getRecorder(Class)} can be used to define a WHERE
 * condition using a method call recording mechanism (see also the first example
 * below). First the programmer must call the desired method on the returned
 * proxy object. This method call is recorded by JaQLib. When JaqLib evaluates
 * the WHERE condition this method call is replayed on every selected element.
 * The result of this method call is then evaluated against the specified
 * condition.
 * </p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage examples:</b><br>
 * Selecting Java objects using XML elements: Jaqlib.XML

 * Selecting Java objects using XML elements and attributes:
